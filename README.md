Hello Alexei,

thank you for your interest in a position at XING. To make sure you are the right candidate we would like to ask you to participate in the following coding challenge.

The task is essentially very simple: impress us! ...and do not overthink what you build. It is all about the how.

Please note that the task is deliberately kept very open. It is not so much about doing it right or wrong, but rather on getting an idea of how you work and how you approach technical challenges.

So another implementation of the popular to-do app or Hackernews portal might do. We intentionally chose to not provide you with any specifications, in order to put you in the best position to show what you are capable of.

But there are some rules we'd like you to follow:

- Please take a maximum of 4 hours to work on the challenge. It is not about delivering a finished product, but to show us what you can do in a given amount of time
- Please provide us with a meaningful git history
- Ideally you use React and, of course, JavaScript

Once again: we do not expect to receive a finished result. We want to see how you work in a given amount of time, how you prioritize and make decisions.

We are also curious to see how you structure and organize your code and how you approach application architecture.

We will have ample opportunity to discuss your results during your final interview. Have fun!
